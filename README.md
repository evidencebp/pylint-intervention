# Pylint Intervention Experiment

## Summary

The use of static analysis alerts assumes that removing the cause of the alert improves the code. Justification mostly comes
from analysis of observations regarding their predictive power. These observations might be noisy due to interference of other
factors. Aim The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the benefit of fixing alerts of various types. Benefit will be measured by both developer opinion and in metric improvement.

## Method 
We present the design of an intervention experiment on the Pylint static analyzer alerts. During the experiment
we identify alerts in open-source projects and intervene to remove them.
