    This class provides a container for all OpenPNM objects in a given
    simulation.

    A simulation is defined as a Network and all of it's associated objects.
    When instantiating a Network, a Project can be passed as an argument, but
    if not given one is created. When instantiating any other object either
    a Network or a Project can be supplied. In the former case, the
    Network's Project is retrieved and used. The end result is that all
    objects are stored in a specific Project.

    The Project to which any object belongs can be retrieved with
    ``obj.project``. Conversely, printing a Project displays a list of all
    objects it contains.

    Moreover, all Projects are registered with the Workspace. Since there can
    be only instance of the Workspace it is possible to view all open Projects
    by printing the Workspace.
