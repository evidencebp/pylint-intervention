def find_neighbor_bonds(sites, im=None, am=None, flatten=True, logic='or'):
    r"""
    Given an incidence matrix, finds all sites that are connected to the
    input sites.

    This function accepts either an incidence or adjacency matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : scipy.sparse matrix
        The incidence matrix of the network.  Must be shaped as (N-sites,
        N-bonds), with non-zeros indicating which sites are connected. Either
        ``am`` or ``im`` must be given.  Passing in ``im`` is slower, but more
        powerful as it allows for an unflattened list of neighbors.

    am : scipy.sparse matrix (optional)
        The adjacency matrix of the network. Either ``am`` or ``im`` must be
        given.  Passing in ``am`` is faster, but does not allow for an
        unflattened list.

    flatten : bool (default is ``True``)
        Indicates whether the returned result is a compressed array of all
        neighbors, or a list of lists with each sub-list containing the
        neighbors for each input site.  Note that an *unflattened* list might
        be slow to generate since it is a Python ``list`` rather than a Numpy
        array.

    logic : str
        Specifies logic to filter the resulting list.  Options are:

        **'or'** : (default) All neighbors of the input sites.  This is also
        known as the 'union' in set theory or 'any' in boolean logic.  Both
        keywords are accepted and treated as 'or'.

        **'xor'** : Only neighbors of one and only one input site.  This is
        useful for finding the sites that are not shared by any of the input
        sites.  'exclusive_or' is also accepted'.

        **'xnor'** : Neighbors that are shared by two or more input sites. This
        is equivalent to finding all neighbors with 'or', minus those found
        with 'xor', and is useful for finding neighbors that the inputs have
        in common.  'nxor' is also accepted.

        **'and'** : Only neighbors shared by all input sites.  This is also
        known as 'intersection' in set theory and (somtimes) as 'all' in
        boolean logic.  Both keywords are accepted and treated as 'and'.

    Returns
    -------
    An array containing the neighboring bonds filtered by the given logic.  If
    ``flatten`` is ``False`` then the result is a list of lists containing the
    neighbors of each given input site.

    See Also
    --------
    find_complement

    Notes
    -----
    The ``logic`` options are applied to neighboring bonds only, thus it is not
    possible to obtain bonds that are part of the global set but not neighbors.
    This is because (a) the list of global bonds might be very large, and
    (b) it is not possible to return a list of neighbors for each input site
    if global sites are considered.

    Given an adjacency matrix, finds which sites are connected to the input

    Parameters
    ----------
    am : scipy.sparse matrix
        The adjacency matrix of the network.  Must be symmetrical such that if
        sites *i* and *j* are connected, the matrix contains non-zero values
        at locations (i, j) and (j, i).

        neighbors for each input site.  Note that an *unflattened* list might
